\title{CMA Output for Functional Regression on CCDS Data}
\format{
A tibble with multiple rows and columns depending on the number of time points:
\describe{
\item{time}{Numeric. The time index, corresponding to \code{seconds}.}
\item{yhat}{Numeric. Estimated difference in fitted values between groups (e.g., use vs non-use).}
\item{scb_low}{Numeric. Lower bound of the simultaneous confidence band for the contrast.}
\item{scb_up}{Numeric. Upper bound of the simultaneous confidence band for the contrast.}
}

\usage{
data(ccds_cma)
}
\description{
This dataset contains the results of contrast-based model assessment (CMA)
applied to a functional regression model fit to the CCDS data using subject-level
functional principal components.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item A functional regression model was fit to \code{percent_change} using subject-level random effects
weighted by the first four eigenfunctions from FPCA.
\item The fitted model was passed to the \code{cma()} function.
\item Simultaneous confidence bands were constructed for the group interested across time.
}

This object is useful for visualizing and testing group-level effects in functional regression models.
