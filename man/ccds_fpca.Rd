\title{CCDS Data with FPCA Eigenfunctions}
\format{
A tibble with N rows and multiple columns:
\describe{
\item{subject_id}{Character. Subject identifier.}
\item{seconds}{Numeric. Time in seconds.}
\item{use}{Numeric. Binary usage indicator; 1 = "use", 0 = otherwise.}
\item{percent_change}{Numeric. Observed percent change in outcome.}
\item{subject}{Character. Equal to subject_id.}
\item{Phi1, Phi2, ..., Phi9}{Numeric. Estimated eigenfunctions from FPCA evaluated at each time point.}
}
}
\source{
See script: \code{data-raw/ccds_fpca.R}
}
\usage{
data(ccds_fpca)
}
\description{
This dataset augments the cleaned CCDS data (\code{ccds}) with estimated eigenfunctions obtained from
functional principal component analysis (FPCA) on the residuals of a fitted GAM mean model.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item A GAM model was first fit on \code{percent_change} with smooth terms for \code{seconds} and interaction with \code{use}.
\item Residuals were extracted and reshaped into a matrix with subjects as rows and time points as columns.
\item FPCA was performed on this residual matrix using \code{\link[refund]{fpca.face}}.
\item The eigenfunctions were merged back into the original CCDS data by \code{seconds}.
}

This object is useful for functional regression and GAMM+FPCA modeling workflows.
