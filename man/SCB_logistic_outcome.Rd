\title{Construct Simultaneous Confidence Bands for a Logistic Regression Outcome}
\usage{
SCB_logistic_outcome(
  df_fit,
  model,
  grid_df = NULL,
  n_boot = 1000,
  alpha = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_fit}{A data frame containing the training design matrix used to fit the logistic model.}

\item{model}{A character string representing the formula for the logistic model (e.g., \code{"y ~ x1 + x2"}).}

\item{grid_df}{A data frame specifying the covariate settings that define the
mean outcome for which simultaneous confidence bands (SCB) are constructed.
Each row represents one covariate combination at which predictions and
SCBs are evaluated. Column names should match variables in the fitted model,
but \code{grid_df} may include only the subset of covariates of interest for the SCB
(it is not required to cover all model variables).
Default is \code{NULL}, in which case the SCB is constructed over the fitted values
based on 'df_fit`.}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap samples used in the non-parametric bootstrap
procedure to generate the empirical distribution. Default is 1000.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for the confidence band (e.g., 0.05 for 95\% confidence).
Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{scb_low}{Lower bound of the simultaneous confidence band.}
\item{Mean}{Predicted mean response from the fitted model.}
\item{scb_up}{Upper bound of the simultaneous confidence band.}
\item{...}{All columns from \code{grid_df}, representing the prediction grid.}
}
}
\description{
This function fits a logistic regression model and constructs simultaneous confidence bands (SCB)
using a non-parametric bootstrap method for the mean outcome of regression on a fixed test set design matrix
}
\examples{
set.seed(262)
x1 <- rnorm(100)
mu <- -1 + x1
p <- expit(mu)
y <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = p)
df <- data.frame(x1 = x1, y = y)
grid <- data.frame(x1 = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 100))
model <- "y ~ x1"
results <- SCB_logistic_outcome(df_fit = df, model = model, grid_df = grid, n_boot = 100)
