\title{Raw longitudinal retinal data from clinical study}
\format{
A data frame with N rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{subject_id}{Character. Subject ID, e.g., "001-002"}
\item{tp}{Character. Timepoint of measurement, e.g., "post"}
\item{eye}{Character. Eye side measured, "Right" or "Left"}
\item{frame}{Integer. Frame index of the measurement}
\item{percent_change}{Numeric. Percent change}
\item{seconds}{Numeric. Time in seconds}
\item{user_cat}{Factor. Usage category: \code{daily}, \code{non-user}, or \code{occasional}}
\item{use}{Character. Simplified binary usage label: "use" or no use}
}
}
\usage{
data(ccds_raw)
}
\description{
This dataset contains repeated measures of percent change in some biomarker over time
for multiple subjects under different use categories. It includes both user and non-user groups,
time points, and metadata related to eye side and frame timing.
}
\details{
This dataset is useful for functional regression and longitudinal modeling involving different user behaviors.
The \code{user_cat} column categorizes participants into \code{"daily"}, \code{"occasional"}, and \code{"non-user"} groups based on usage frequency.
The \code{use} column is a simplified binary indicator, where \code{"use"} corresponds to subjects actively using the treatment/device,
typically derived from the \code{user_cat} value.
