\title{Cleaned CCDS dataset (Right Eye, Post Timepoint)}
\format{
A tibble with N rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{subject_id}{Character. Subject identifier.}
\item{seconds}{Numeric. Time in seconds since initial measurement.}
\item{use}{Numeric. Binary indicator of usage status; \code{1} indicates "use", \code{0} otherwise.}
\item{percent_change}{Numeric. Percent change in the outcome of interest.}
\item{subject}{Character. Equal to subject_id.}
}
}
\source{
Processed from \code{data-raw/ccds_preprocess.R} using the \code{here} and \code{dplyr} packages.
}
\usage{
data(ccds)
}
\description{
This dataset is a cleaned subset of \code{ccds_raw}, including only measurements taken from the right eye
at the post-intervention timepoint (\code{tp == "post"}). It is preprocessed and ready for functional outcome modeling.
}
\details{
The data was filtered to include only right-eye measurements at the post timepoint from the original \code{ccds_raw} dataset.
The \code{use} variable is derived from a character column, with \code{"use"} mapped to \code{1}, and all other values to \code{0}.
