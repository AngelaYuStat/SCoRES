## Test environments
* Local R installation, Windows 11, R 4.4.0
* GitHub Actions: macOS-arm64 (R-devel), Linux (R-devel), Windows (R-devel)
* All checks completed successfully on these platforms.

## R CMD check results
There were **no ERRORs**, **WARNINGs** or **no NOTEs**.

There was one **INFO** message:

checking installed package size ... INFO
installed size is 5.0Mb
sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
data 4.0Mb

This size is expected and justified.  
The data directory contains essential **climate and geospatial datasets** used in the examples and vignettes.  
These datasets are necessary to demonstrate the packageâ€™s core functionality, including spatial modeling and reproducible analyses.  
All data have been appropriately reduced, subsetted, and compressed to the minimal size required for functionality testing and illustration.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.

## Additional notes
* The package passes R CMD check --as-cran on all major operating systems.
* This is the first submission of the package **SCoRES (version 0.1.0)** to CRAN.
