Description: We present SCoRES, which provides useful statistical tools for both the 
  estimation of the inverse regions and the corresponding simultaneous outer and 
  inner confidence regions. Acceptable forms of input includes both 1D and 2D data 
  for linear regression, logistic regression, functional regression and spatial 
  generalized least squares regression. Useful functions are also provided for 
  constructing simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) for these models.
